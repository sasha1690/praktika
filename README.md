# Tic Tac Toe C++
Tic Tac Toe C++
This project implements a simple game "Tic Tac Toe" in C++ for two players. One player puts a cross, and the other puts a zero. The winner is the player who first finds a line (horizontally, parallel, diagonally) of crosses or zeros. There is a draw in the game, if all the cells of the field are occupied, and none of the players has collected a line, then there is a draw.
## Futures 
- **Board Display**: Shows the current state of the board.
- **Player Moves:** Player makes his move
- **Win/Loss Checks** Determines whether a player has won or lost
- **Score Tracking:** Reads and writes win/loss statistics from/to a file.
- **Save Logs** Saves all actions that have been performed in the game


## This C++ code snippet defines and initializes an array for the Tic-Tac-Toe game board and a variable to keep track of the current player.
